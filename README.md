## Suggested approach to install geopandas in Windows
[Geopandas installation the easy way for windows](https://towardsdatascience.com/geopandas-installation-the-easy-way-for-windows-31a666b3610f)

## Installation
- Download and clone this repository.

- Create a virtual environment using:
```
conda env create -n geospatial-environment --file geospatial-environment.yml
```
- Once the environment is created, it can be activates using:
```conda activate geospatial```

- To create new kernel for jupyter notebook:
``` 
python -m ipykernel install --user --name geospatial-environment --display-name "geospatial-environment"
```

## Uninstallation
If the environment is not required any more, it can be removed using:
```conda env remove -n geospatial```

## Package requirements
Check `geospatial-environment.yml` file
