# Installation
- Download and clone this repository.

- Create a virtual environment using:
```
conda env create -n geospatial --file geospatial-environment.yml
```
- Once the environment is created, it can be activates using:
```conda activate geospatial```

- To create new kernel for jupyter notebook:
``` 
python -m ipykernel install --user --name geospatial --display-name "geospatial"
```

# Uninstallation
If the environment is not required any more, it can be removed using:
```conda env remove -n geospatial```

# Package requirements
The packages required for running the script are as follows:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- geoplot
- geopandas (version 0.8.2 or above)
- shapely
- plotly
- networkx
